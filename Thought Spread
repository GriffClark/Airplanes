There is a decent amount of thoughtwork that needs to go into this before I continue. 

List of problems that need thinking through:

1) building the fuel graph
2) too many people being put into airports after correct? number of people being generated
3a) how do people figure out where they want to go
3b) how are flights generated based on where people are going (or is it the other way around)
4) how do military airports and private airports fit into this
5) what will the actual simulation look like for the AI
6) what decisions can a airline company make
	* buy planes
	* build unique flight algorithims that are different from the basic one I create that everyone can use
	* figure out what speed planes will travel at, or build an algorithm different from the basic one that I will provide. However, fuel tables will remain the same
	* figure out if they are transporting people or cargo, and set flight routes
	* buy more planes
	* re-fuel planes
	* sell planes (for less then they bought them for, obviously
	* take out a loan
	*are you allowed to oversell a flight?
7) how is this all going to fit together on a grid
8) what will the visual representation of this look like
9) which other airplanes will I build, and where will I get the data for them?
10) how does the ticket system work and how does it handle requests?
11) do people get older?
12) how will the crew system work (hiring pilots and flight attendants)?
13) are there random events like whether and such that will affect each simulation uniquely?
14) how do people choose which airline they want to fly
15) how to I value whether earning more money or a better reputation is more important?
16) how will I actually keep the simulation running
17) all the nonsense that goes into building an AI
